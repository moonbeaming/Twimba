# Cat Image Picker

## About Project

This is a website I created with what I learnt from Scrimba's Frontend Career Path Course, using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. It provides pictures at random, from a couple of images provided by [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/), matching whichever emotion you want the cat in the image to have. You can access the website [here](https://cat-image-picker.vercel.app/).

## Features

- Choose from a variety of emotions
- Select whether you only want animated images/GIFs
- Close the modal by clicking outside of it, as well as the usual default cross button

## Skills Used/Learned

Through this project, I picked up essential Javascript concepts like how to use:
- for... of loop
- radio & checkbox inputs
- querySelector
- getElementsbyClassName
- classList.remove
- .includes()
- .filter()
