# Cat Image Picker

## About Project

This is a website I created with what I learnt from Scrimba's Frontend Career Path Course, using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. It is a Twitter clone, with a couple of core functionalities the actual app has. Assets are provided by [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). You can access the website [here]([https://cat-image-picker.vercel.app/](https://twimba.vercel.app/)).
