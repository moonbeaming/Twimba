# Twimba, Twitter Clone
## About Project

This is a website I created with what I learnt from Scrimba's Frontend Career Path Course, using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Javascript ES6**. It is a Twitter clone, with a couple of core functionalities the actual app has. Assets are provided by [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). You can access the website [here](https://twimba.vercel.app/).

## Features

- View the feed and tweet replies
- Write a tweet and submit it to see it in the feed immediately
- Like/unlike and retweet/unretweet a tweet (retweeting does not send the tweet to any other feed)

## Skills Used/Learned

Through this project, I picked up essential Javascript concepts like how to use:
- .forEach()
- data attributes
- Content Delivery Networks(CDNs)
  - generate UUIDs
  - external icons
- conditionally render styles
